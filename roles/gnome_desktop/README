This role configures GNOME to work how I like, setting some sane defaults and
installing a couple minor extensions, etc.

It also uninstalls a lot of what I dub "Gnome Junk", which includes a lot of
"normie" applications like "weather" and the software "store" which I have never
used and will never want.

Huge shout-out to Evan Klitzke, whose post inspired a lot of the removal/cleanup
stuff herein:
